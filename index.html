                    <p>My name is Donovan Youkhana and i am currently 21 years old. Some things that i love are sports, i look forward to every sunday just to watch football because i do fantasy football. Also i enjoy video games which is a huge reason i was always so interested in computer science and coding. I was originally born in Michigan and lived there for 9 years of my life, we had moved to Arizona in 2008 for my dads buisness but it wasnt the worst things because most of our cousins lived anyways so it was kind of a win. I have a family of 5 including myself, two brothers and my mother and father. I am very grateful of them because most parents and or family members would not be too happy about their child taking this turn in their life away from traditional schooling and going into non traditional. This is my first time experimenting with coding and yes its been rough and i know its going to be but i like to think of it as learning English or Spanish for the first time, at first its rough and you feel like you will never fully understand it but once you put in enough time and hard work then it becomes a second nature for you and thats something im very excited to happen with coding.
